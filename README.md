## 🌟 Hey there! I’m Joelma Renata and I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer.
With nearly a decade of experience in software development, I’ve worked on both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on scalable, high-performance applications. My journey started with curiosity, evolved into a deep passion for problem-solving, and has led me to work with leading companies in finance and technology.

## 💼 Where I’ve made an impact:
XP Investimentos (2021 - Present) – As a Senior Software Engineer, I focus on performance optimization, system modernization, and user experience improvements in the financial sector. I’m part of the Product-Led Growth (PLG) team, where I work on initiatives like MGM (Member Get Member), helping drive customer acquisition and engagement through innovative growth strategies.
Sovos (2019 - 2021) – At Sovos, I contributed to tax compliance solutions, ensuring scalability, security, and front-end best practices in complex financial systems.
Grupo Minha Vida & Crodity SaaS – Earlier in my career, I worked on health and SaaS platforms, gaining experience in different industry verticals while honing my front-end development skills.

## 🚀 What drives me?
I thrive on challenges, enjoy stepping out of my comfort zone, and believe in continuous learning. My expertise lies in React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and performance optimization, with a strong focus on building efficient, user-friendly applications. 
Lately, I’ve been expanding my knowledge to leadership and product growth skills, combining technical expertise with a strategic mindset to drive impact beyond just code.

## 🌍 Beyond code
Outside of work, I enjoy sailing, a perfect balance between adventure and tranquility. I stay active with daily workouts, reading, and learning new languages. Passionate about knowledge-sharing, I recently authored an ebook on career growth, offering insights to help others navigate and accelerate their transition to tech careers.
